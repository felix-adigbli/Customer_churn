# Customer_churn
1.1	Problem Definition

Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Customers may decide to cease using a company's product or service for several reasons, including cost, unhappiness with the service and product selection, or poor customer service. For telco businesses, it is essential to both draw in new clients and curb consumer churn. When consumers leave, it is quite expensive for the business. A high churn rate adversely affects profits, impede growth and considerable impact on the market share. Predicting whether a particular consumer will go, or stay is the main challenge. Finding the crucial elements of churning presents a unique problem.

The key challenge is to predict if an individual customer will churn or not. The problem at hand is to predict customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of a customer discontinuing their relationship with a company or service. In the context of this project, I aim to develop a machine learning model using supervised that can accurately identify customers who are at risk of churning. This is crucial for businesses as it allows them to implement targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates and enhance customer loyalty.

1.2	Definition of the Project Objectives and Goals
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are at risk of churning. This involves:
a.	Analyzing customer data to uncover patterns and characteristics that differentiate churned customers from those who stay.
b.	Training a machine learning model, in this case, a Random Forest classifier, to predict the likelihood of churn based on customer attributes.
c.	Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability in making predictions.
